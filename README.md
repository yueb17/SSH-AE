This paper proposes a spatial-structural auto-encoder for layout representation learning. The layout element patterns are considered from both spatial and structural perspectives in a hierarchical modeling fashion. Correspondingly, we propose to use a new tree-edit distance (TED) based metric to evaluate the layout representation quality from structural aspect, which further provides a comprehensive evaluation protocol. In addition, we newly collect a POSTER dataset containing diverse design template for future research work of layout related topics.

## Code and dataset will be available.
